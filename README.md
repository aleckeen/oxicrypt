# OxiCrypt

A cryptography library that is mainly implemented in Rust. I aim to implement bindings to other languages such as C/C++ and Python. This project is just to learn more about cryptographic algorithms and experimenting with FFI. I don't know much about cryptography, so if you want to use a cryptography library you should use other libraries that are well-tested and written by people who know their stuff.
